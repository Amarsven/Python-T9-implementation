Python T9 implementation
====================================

A simple [T9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T9_(predictive_text)) implementation in python using bio pythons trie

This is a basic T9 project that turns your numpad into a T9 Nokia experience.
It is not only retro but allows you to type with one hand. 
This small project is still far from the proper experience as it used to function. 

Here’s what we can add later to emulate a full Nokia T9 experience:

Word suggestions & cycling
Like classic phones: press # to cycle through words that match 4663 → "good", "home", etc.

Multi-line message view
Accumulate words into a "message" with live preview, deletable with *, etc.

Real-time typing
Display typed letters as you go, like predictive typing with abc, def, ghi...

Export message / simulate SMS
Save typed text or simulate sending.

Arrow key or +/- support to cycle
For better keyboard flow without # key.
